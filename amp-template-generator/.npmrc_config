# This is a local (project) npm config file for connecting to the gitlab registry.
# During docker-compose up, the file is copied as .npmrc, packages are installed,
# and then the copied file is deleted. This is to prevent local NPM development
# in this directory from being blocked because ${} is a docker thing, not a NPM thing.

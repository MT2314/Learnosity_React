    <h1>Indigenous knowledge</h1>
    <p>Indigenous Peoples have a special relationship with Earth and all living things. For as long as can be remembered, Indigenous peoples have practiced sustainability by not taking too much from the land without giving back and caring
        for it. </p>
    <p>Indigenous Guardians programs are Indigenous-led conservation and stewardship initiatives that work to honour the relationship between land and people. Guardians work on behalf of their Nations and communities, and there are over 80
        programs operating across the country. They monitor different traditional territories and make sure everyone is being responsible and taking care of the land. Learn a little more about land guardians in this video.</p>
    <p>Explore the following <em>Land Needs Guardians</em> video entitled "What Do Guardians Do" to learn more about land guardians.</p>

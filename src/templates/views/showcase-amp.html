Alright, maybe that is too much to expect, you know maybe a math book, curling up with it is too much. But what if - if you have been watching prime time TV curling up in bed , you may have been unwittingly immersed in math made palatable, names like Euler, Leibnitz,  Fibonnacci, Reimann have figured prominently in some some of the hottest TV series they have had starring roles in the television drama, “Numb3rs”. Which listen to this numbers just beat out “Law and Order: Trial by Jury”, as the top show on Friday nights on television - a math program.</p>\n<p>And if you been paying careful attention, you may have seen math sneakily featured in The Adventures of the Simpsons, not so sneaky - movies like Good Will Hunting and A Beautiful Mind have made math actually something to talk about apres film over a double latte.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So pop culture is making mathematicians look better but is it helping math teachers motivate their students? April is Mathematics Awareness Month, but you knew that - right?  So it might be a good time to take a closer look at the numbers, and if you like to talk about mathematics in your life give us a call. Our  number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989- talk.  We can't  balance your cheque books but we will be able to talk about all kinds of other kinds of math.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let me introduce my guest, Keith Devlin is the author of the new book, The Math Instinct: Why You are a Mathematical Genius.  He is also the Executive Director of the Centre for the Study of Language and Information. He is a Consulting Professor of Mathematics at Stanford. And you might know him as “that math guy” on Weekend Edition on NPR, he is in the studio on the campus there. Thanks for being with us, Dr. Devlin.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Keith Devlin): Good afternoon, Ira,  thanks for having me back again.<br />\n(Host): You’re welcome.  Robert Osserman is a Professor Emeritus at Stanford, he is also Special Projects Director at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. He joins us from his studio at the campus at University of California at Berkeley. Welcome back to Science Friday.<br />\n(Robert Osserman): Thank you, Ira, it’s a pleasure to be here.  Hi Keith.</p>\n<p>(Keith Devlin): Hi there, Bob.  </p>\n<p>(Host):  There you go, just saved you money on a phone call.   Sarah Greenwald is Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Appalachian State University. She joins us from the campus in Boone, North Carolina. Thank you for being with us Dr. Greenwald.</p>\n<p>(Sarah Greenwald) Thanks, I’m very pleased to be here. And hello to everyone.</p>\n<p>(Keith): Hello there.</p>\n<p>(Robert): Hi Sarah.</p>\n<p>(Host): Keith, Is math turning up in more places or are we just you know, making that up?<br />\n(Keith Devlin): (laughing) It certainly is taking off, it’s turning up in a lot of places. I would like to think that efforts by Bob and myself and people like us have partly contributed to this. I think the  biggest impetus was 1994 when Andrew Wiles solved Fermat’s Last Theorem and just thrust mathematics in the front pages of the newspapers and really made it a hip subject.</p>\n<p>(Host): Good Will Hunting, you know that was pretty good, and so is Proof and Pi and that play…..</p>\n<p>(Keith Devlin):  You bet, yeah it has become part of the culture in a much bigger way then it has ever was done before.    </p>\n<p>(Host): Bob, you agree with that?</p>\n<p>(Robert Osserman): Oh absolutely, it's interesting. I've looked back and past and there have been isolated movies, plays and things, books that refer to math but there has been an explosion in the last 10 years which is quite remarkable</p>\n<p>(Host): And Dr. Greenwald you have written a really interesting paper at least one of, I'm sure there are more of them, on something called “Engaging Students with Significant Mathematical Content from the Simpsons”. Now a lot of people watch the Simpsons, but you talk about at least one program in the Simpsons where Bart excels in school and they send him to a high priced high influential math class</p>\n<p>(Sarah Greenwald):  Yes, that's correct. I should say there are a lot of writers with significant mathematics in their back ground working for the Simpsons and so they naturally sneak some math into the background of the show.</p>\n<p>(Host): Do they do it on purpose?</p>\n<p>(Sarah Greenwald): Yes, I got a chance to talk to David Cohen recently when I was out in California recently and I am working on an interview that will be on my website eventually and he said that on the show Futurama where he was the head writer, he could set the tone and since he was interested in math it was pretty easy for him to wedge some references there. You know the Simpsons has so many different references related to many different fields, so if you’re interested in law or if you are interested in something else, you can find something related to your field, and mathematics is just one of the things you can be looking for in these different episodes.</p>\n<p>(Host): What about female mathematicians? Do we see them popping up anywhere in popular culture?</p>\n<p>(Sarah Greenwald):  Well on some shows that Joss Wheedon had done, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel,  the people that seem to be good in science and math were actually the women in those shows. So a little bit in those shows and the Simpsons pokes fun at gender issues and mathematics.  On a recent episode, there was a joke about that men were no longer allowed  to take mathematics in the future at Yale and Lisa was debating between taking  “femistry and galgebra”.    </p>\n<p>(laughing)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Interview continues to 47:51)</p>\n",

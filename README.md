# demo-component-library

A remote app to test with module federation spike. This spike demonstrates how components can be shared with demo-lesson-builder through module-federation. With module-federation we were able to remove craftjs depencies from the widgets.  The widgets can now be viewed within demo-component-library and are not reliant on demo-lesson-builder.
